- ✅ **Validation checks** for all repositories

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
```bash
# Authentication problems
gh auth logout && gh auth login

# npm registry issues
npm logout && npm login --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com

# Git history issues
pip install git-filter-repo  # Better than filter-branch

# Dependency conflicts
npm cache clean --force && npm install
```

### Recovery Options
- **Complete backup** available for rollback
